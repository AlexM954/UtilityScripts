# UtilityScripts
These are some scripts I've written for personal use. It often occurs that I need to move specific filetypes and / or rename specific files and folders. These Python scripts help with that.

## Contents
### Move
The move script simply moves files from one location to another. It has optional regex pattern matching and can optionally move directories.

### List
The list script lists files or directories. It has optional regex pattern matching and can optionally make a list that is compatible with the rename script.

### Rename
The rename script takes a csv file of a specific format, most easily created using the list script. It'll go through the file renaming all files or directories specified within.
